# Digit_Recognization_System
This project implements a handwritten digit recognition system utilizing TensorFlow and Keras.The dataset is preprocessed by flattening the 28x28 pixel images into 784-dimensional vectors and normalizing pixel values to a range of 0 to 1. A fully connected neural network is constructed with an input layer of 784 neurons, .
